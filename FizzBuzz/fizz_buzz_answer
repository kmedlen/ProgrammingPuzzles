""" For this part of the challenge, I wanted the flexibilty to have the user enter 2 different numbers
I chose 2 different inputs, and understood the ability to use them in a variable, however, upon doing so
I got the error "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'list' and 'int'" """


# i figured out the above error because I had my variable inputs set each in their own parenthesis marks, like range(first), (second) - 
# it must have not been able to iterate through the for loop becuase of how it was reading the variables.

second = input('Enter second number: ')
