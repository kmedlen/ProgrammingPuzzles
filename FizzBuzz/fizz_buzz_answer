# First I had to look up how to iterate through a set of numbers.
# Found range, but needed a for loop with a nested 'if' clause to iterate through

for count in range(1, 26):

# At first, it did not print any numbers, just words. So I read online where the logic is "if the statement = 0, then it's True"
# this first 'if' gave me lot of trouble. I understood the logic, but had it placed as the 2nd
# 'elif' statement, and 15  would not print as FizzBuzz. After some digging, saw that logically
# putting it first makes it work.

        if count % 3 == 0 and count % 5 == 0:
                print"FizzBuzz"
        elif count % 3 == 0:
                print "Fizz"
        elif count % 5 == 0:
                print "Buzz"
        else:
                print count
